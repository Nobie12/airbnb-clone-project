# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

## 🚀 Objective

The backend for the **Airbnb Clone** project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It aims to replicate the core functionalities of Airbnb while ensuring performance, scalability, and security.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

## 🔐 API Security

Security is at the core of the Airbnb Clone backend to protect users, properties, transactions, and all sensitive operations. The following key security measures will be implemented:

### 1. **Authentication**
- **Technology**: Token-based authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that only registered users can access their own data and perform actions like booking or leaving a review.

### 2. **Authorization**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Admins, hosts, and guests will have different levels of access.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive resources (e.g., only a property owner should be able to delete their listing).

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- **Tool**: Django REST Framework Throttling or a service like **API Gateway/Nginx** + **Redis**.
- **Why it matters**: Protects the API from brute-force attacks, spamming, or abuse by limiting how often a user can call certain endpoints.

### 4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
- **Tool**: Django’s built-in validators and serializers.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents injection attacks (SQL, script injection) and ensures only safe, clean data enters the system.

### 5. **HTTPS Everywhere**
- **Tool**: Enforced via Nginx + SSL Certificates (Let's Encrypt).
- **Why it matters**: Encrypts data in transit to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, especially important during login and payment.

### 6. **Payment Security**
- **Tool**: Integration with a secure payment processor like **Stripe** or **PayPal**.
- **Why it matters**: Sensitive credit card information is handled securely and in compliance with **PCI DSS** standards.

### 7. **CSRF & CORS Protection**
- **CSRF**: Handled for authenticated POST/PUT requests in forms.
- **CORS**: Whitelisted domains using Django CORS headers.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents cross-site request forgery and data leakage between unauthorized origins.

### 8. **Audit Logs & Monitoring**
- **Tool**: Logging user actions and failures (e.g., login attempts).
- **Why it matters**: Helps trace malicious activity, detect data breaches, and maintain accountability.

### 🚨 Why API Security Matters for This Project

| Project Feature     | Why Security is Critical                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Management** | Protect personal data like emails, passwords, and profiles.   |
| **Properties**      | Prevent fake listings, unauthorized edits, or deletions.      |
| **Bookings**        | Stop booking hijacking, duplication, or denial-of-service.    |
| **Payments**        | Safeguard financial data and prevent fraud.                   |
| **Reviews**         | Prevent spam or malicious content that can harm user trust.   |



## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently (CI), and automatically test, build, and deploy that code to production or staging environments (CD). This ensures faster development cycles, fewer bugs, and smoother updates.

### Why It’s Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in the Airbnb Clone project:

- ✅ **Automates Testing**: Ensures new features or fixes don’t break existing functionality.
- 🚀 **Speeds Up Deployment**: Changes can be deployed to staging or production with minimal manual effort.
- 🔒 **Improves Code Quality**: Automated checks and formatting help enforce consistent, clean code.
- 👥 **Enables Collaboration**: Helps multiple developers work together without conflicts or delays.
- 🔄 **Reduces Human Error**: Automation reduces the risk of mistakes during manual deployments.

### Tools We Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates code testing, linting, building Docker images, and deployment steps.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages multi-container applications like Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis together.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean** *(Optional)*: Deployment targets for staging or production environments.
- **Celery + Redis** *(Asynchronous tasks)*: Workers run in the background and are deployed alongside the app.

### Example Workflow

1. **Push to GitHub** →  
2. **GitHub Actions** run tests and lint code →  
3. **Build Docker container** →  
4. **Deploy to production or staging server** →  
5. **Notify team of successful deployment**
